Poker Dice
==========

I like to use the poker dice problem as an open-ended interview question
to see how a candidate explores a design space.  This problem is small
enough to be explained simply, too big to be "completed" in any
reasonable interview scenario, and contains a few interesting twists
that make for interesting discussion.

If you're completely new to poker dice, check out the ./features directory.  I recommend reading the files there in this order:

- scoring.feature
- comparing_hands.feature
- round.feature
